# CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md — CNJ Mesh
**For AI assistants:** Fetch this file at the start of every session. It is the authoritative current-state summary of Charles's infrastructure. Do not ask him to re-explain anything documented here. Treat him as an experienced operator. When presenting the todo list, always show ALL items including medium and longer projects — never summarize or truncate. Ask which todo item to start on and get to work.

## Who You're Talking To
- **Charles Somogyi**, K2GIA — experienced operator, ~25 years IT/backup/recovery background (Dell Technologies SE)
- Based in Kendall Park / South Brunswick, NJ
- Built CNJ Mesh from scratch into a 300+ node Meshtastic network, later expanded to dual-protocol (Meshtastic + MeshCore)
- Not a software developer but highly technical — explain things plainly, don't over-explain basics he clearly already knows

## Infrastructure Quick Reference

### Hosts
| Host | Hardware | IP | User | Role |

### USB Device Map on cnjmesh1
| Device | What it is |
|---|---|
| /dev/ttyACM0 | Observer (WisMesh Pocket RAK4631) |
| /dev/ttyUSB1 | KPR1 (CP2102, serial 0001) |
| /dev/ttyUSB2 | Digirig (unique serial beb31e2f) — APRS PTT |
| /dev/ttyUSB3 | Client 1 (CP2102, serial 0001) |

After any USB changes always restart meshcore-packet-capture: `docker restart meshcore-packet-capture`

### meshcore-packet-capture
- Config files bind-mounted to host at `/opt/meshcore-packet-capture/config.d/`
- Container recreate command:
```
docker run -d \
  --name meshcore-packet-capture \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --privileged \
  --group-add dialout \
  --device /dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0 \
  -v /opt/meshcore-packet-capture/config.d:/etc/meshcore-packet-capture/config.d \
  ghcr.io/agessaman/meshcore-packet-capture:latest
```

### mesh-discord-shim
- Location: `/opt/stacks/mesh-discord-shim/`
- Env file: `/opt/stacks/mesh-discord-shim/.env`
- Webhooks:
  - `NEW_NODE_WEBHOOK` → MeshCore NJ Discord `#cnj-new-node-relay`
  - `PUBLIC_CHAT_WEBHOOK` → MeshCore NJ Discord `#centralnj-mc-channel-relay`
  - `NJ_MQTT_WEBHOOK` → MeshCore NJ Discord `#meshcore-nj-mqtt`
- Channel filtering: only CentralNJ-MC and meshcore-nj-mqtt messages posted — Public channel intentionally excluded
- Deduplicates by packet_hash to prevent duplicate posts
- Discord category: `mesh-to-discord-relays-no-public`

### MeshCore Hub Channels
- Public — key: `8b3387e9c5cdea6ac9e5edbaa115cd72`
- CentralNJ-MC — key: `dcc94b369feeee309800ee15a12403ed`
- meshcore-nj-mqtt — key: `90746153489710a870d23abb50cc9e42` ← new statewide NJ community channel

### MQTT Credentials
| Broker | Host | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Local (cnjmesh1) | localhost | meshdev / large4cats |
| CNJ Mesh public | mqtt.cnjmesh.me | meshuser / large4cats |
| SJMesh | mqtt.sjmesh.net:1883 | meshuser / mesh4life |
| MeshOmatic | us-east.meshomatic.net:31883 | user_somog / (in mosquitto.conf) |

### Key Config Notes
- **Graywolf PTT:** `/dev/ttyUSB2`, `serial_rts`, stored in `/var/lib/graywolf/graywolf.db` table `ptt_configs` column `device`
- **Graywolf watchdog DISABLED** — was restarting every 5 min breaking PTT. Do NOT re-enable.
- **POLLERR errors are cosmetic** — APRS works through them
- **Code edits:** always use Python script approach (`cat > /tmp/fix.py`), never sed for complex edits
- **MeshOmatic** — their MQTT broker goes down periodically. Not a CNJ Mesh problem.

- Fixed event type mismatch (`channel_message` vs `channel_msg_recv`) ✅
- Fixed duplicate message posting via packet_hash deduplication ✅
- Created `meshcore-nj-mqtt` channel — statewide NJ community channel for RF + MQTT users ✅
- Registered `meshcore-nj-mqtt` on MeshCore Hub ✅
- Added `#meshcore-nj-mqtt` Discord relay to mesh-discord-shim ✅

## Todo List (Priority Order) — Last updated 2026-07-12

### Quick Wins
1. Invite NJ MeshCore operators to join meshcore-nj-mqtt channel (share QR from meshcorehub.cnjmesh.me/channels)
2. Get Tilly and y0gurt to point their observers at mqtt.cnjmesh.me
3. NWS alerts for MeshCore NJ Discord — verify on next real alert
4. NWS Middlesex focused forecasts for north/south channels
5. Add meshcore-packet-capture health check / auto-restart on Observer disconnect

### Back Burner
- Remove dead MeshOmatic section from mosquitto.conf — verify first
- Remove dead meshshadow section from cloudflared config — verify first
- Rotate Discord webhook URLs — low priority
- Rotate MeshOmatic password — low priority

### Medium Projects
6. Node tagging in hub (KPR1, KPR2, Observer)
7. KPR1 retirement decision
8. Discord server security review
9. APRS Discord silent-alert monitor
10. T096 + Alfa mobile setup (needs SMA→RP-SMA adapter)
11. LoRa APRS 433MHz arriving July 14 — configure 433.775/62.5kHz
12. Broker-to-broker bridging with LV Mesh / SJ Mesh for meshcore-nj-mqtt

### Longer Projects
13. cnjmesh3 full setup — awaiting replacement Pi 3B+
14. cnjmesh3 becomes upstairs RF hub — Observer + KPR2 + LoRa APRS node
15. Client 1 replacement with RAK/WisMesh
16. Cross-mesh bridge via mesh-api
17. MeshOmatic relay script
18. KPR2 watchdog
